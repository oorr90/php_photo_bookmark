# PHP Photo Bookmark

The user inputs an image URL with a caption and alt tag, then sees the information on the confirmation page. Project inserts into the database. Also practiced styling with CSS.

## Getting Started

I used MAMP and my local server to test this project. Download the project files and insert your own databse connection details instead of the placeholders (line 23 - 26 in photo.php)
